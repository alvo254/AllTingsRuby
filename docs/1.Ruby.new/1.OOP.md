# Ruby Is an Object-Oriented Language
Letâ€™s say it again. Ruby is a genuine object-oriented language. Everything you manipulate
is an object, and the results of those manipulations are themselves objects. However, many
languages make the same claim, and their users often have a different interpretation of what
object-oriented means and a different terminology for the concepts they employ.
