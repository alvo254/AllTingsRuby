Often, when programming, you need to create a name for something significant. For example,
you might want to refer to the compass points by name, so you’d write this:

NORTH = 1
EAST = 2
SOUTH = 3
WEST = 4

Then, in the rest of your code, you could use the constants instead of the numbers:
walk(NORTH)
look(EAST)

Most of the time, the actual numeric values of these constants are irrelevant (as long as they
are unique). All you want to do is differentiate the four directions.

Ruby offers a cleaner alternative. Symbols are simply constant names that you don’t have to
predeclare and that are guaranteed to be unique. A symbol literal starts with a colon and is
normally followed by some kind of name:
walk(:north)
look(:east)
There’s no need to assign some kind of value to a symbol—Ruby takes care of that for you.
Ruby also guarantees that no matter where it appears in your program, a particular symbol
will have the same value. That is, you can write the following:

def walk(direction)
	if direction == :north
		# ....
	end
end
