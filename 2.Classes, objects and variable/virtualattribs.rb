# These attribute-accessing methods do not have to be just simple wrappers around an objectâ€™s instance variables. For example, you may want to access the price as an exact number of cents, rather than as a floating-point number of dollars
class BookInStock

    attr_accessor :price

    def initialize(isbn, price)
        @isbn = isbn
        @price = Float(price)

        Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
    end
#     We can take this even further and allow people to assign to our virtual attribute, mapping
# the value to the instance variable internally:
    def pricecents=(cents)
        @price = cents / 100.0
    end
